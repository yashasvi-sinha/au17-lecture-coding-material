            <p>"Known as the Missile Man of India, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam contributed not only to science but also served as the 11th President of India and was widely regarded as the 'People's President'.
                As an aerospace scientist, Kalam worked with India's two major space research organisations--Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
               He often spoke to children and the country's youth — inspiring them to think big in life; he also penned a number of books. Here are some of his most inspiring quotes"</p>

        <p>When Dr Kalam became the President I served him as the prime minister for more than three years. 
        He was the one who administered me the oath of office and secrecy and my relationship with him was that of great friendship.
        He recognised the problems that I had in managing a difficult coalition government. 
        Yet, another important issue that came before our government was the familiar nuclear deal with the United States. 
        I took the precaution of keeping the President fully in the picture at various stages of negotiation. 
        I used to brief him and I was very happy when he endorsed what we were doing. </p>
