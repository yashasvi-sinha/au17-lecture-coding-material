            <h2 style="background-color:rgb(180, 180, 180);"> Early Life and Education </h2>
                <p style="color: darkblue;"> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on <b>15 October 1931</b> to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre 
                of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of <a href="https://vikaspedia.in/e-governance/states/tamil-nadu">Tamil Nadu.</a> His father Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
                His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income.</p>
            
                <p style="color: darkblue;"> In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a <em><b>bright and hardworking student</b></em> who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, 
                from where he graduated in <b>physics in 1954</b>.</p>
            
                <p style="color: darkblue;"> He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
                <i><mark>"I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline"</mark></i>. He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
