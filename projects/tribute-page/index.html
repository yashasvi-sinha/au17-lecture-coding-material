                    <h2> Early Life and Education </h2>
                    <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on <b>15 October 1931</b> to a Tamil Muslim
                        family in the pilgrimage centre
                        of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of <a
                            href="https://vikaspedia.in/e-governance/states/tamil-nadu">Tamil Nadu.</a> His father
                        Jainulabdeen was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a
                        housewife.
                        His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
                        now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an
                        early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a <em><b>bright and
                                hardworking student</b></em> who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his
                        studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher
                        Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
                        Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras,
                        from where he graduated in <strong>physics in 1954</strong>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of
                        Technology.While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with
                        his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was
                        finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later
                        said to him,
                        <i><mark>"I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult
                                deadline"</mark></i>. He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter
                        pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
                    </p>
